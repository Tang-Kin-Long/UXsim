    print_mode=1, save_mode=1, show_mode=1,    # Various options. print_mode determines whether to print information. Usually set to 1, but recommended 0 when running multiple simulations automatically. save_mode determines if visualization results are saved. show_mode determines if visualization results are displayed. It's good to set show_mode=1 on Jupyter Notebook, otherwise recommended 0.
    random_seed=0    # Set the random seed. Specify if you want repeatable experiments. If not, set to None.
